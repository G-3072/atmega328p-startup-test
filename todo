- currently assuming linker symbols like _sdata _dataLMA are byte addresses if not working try writing code for word addresses
- find a way to look at what linker sybols are (_sdata _edata _sbss etc)
- datacopy loop and zerobss loop fail if .data and .bss have nothing in them so _sdata == _edata & _sbss == _ebss
